[Intellij](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is great. But even better if you add beautiful colors to it.

[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is a popular color scheme. It can be applied for a numbers of applications (intellij amongst them).


And this is how intellij looks like after applying this great colors.

Here are installation [instructions](https://github.com/jkaving/intellij-colors-solarized).

I highly reccomend trying it out!
