I created simple utils ([link][1] to github project) that display ads from admob mediation. 

I also included [TapForTap][2] as one of the providers. This service is really great. It advertise your app for free. In return you will need to display ads of other app to earn points for displaying your own ads. 

What ads providers do you use in your app?
