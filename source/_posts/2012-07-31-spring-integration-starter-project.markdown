After hearing here and there how great [spring integration][1] is, I decided to check it out.

Before you start, first you should read [Enterprise Integration Patterns][2] for reference.
Another worth checking source of information is springsource
examples github [repository][3].

Springsource shares [information][4] how to configure your pom.

Spring integration is devided into ``spring-integration-core`` and additional modules such as ``spring-integration-jmx`` or ``spring-integration-twitter``.
