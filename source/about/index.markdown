I started my adventure with programming over 6 years ago. Most of the time I was creating enterprise applications in the java world. If you want to know more about my career, please see my [LinkedIn Profile][2]. 

About 2 years ago I switched to a startup environment. And what a switch it was. An ocean of fresh technologies, can-do attitude in surrounding me people and possiblity to really see how your software grows together with you. 

Not so long after, in addition to my day to day contractor work, I decided to start my own thing. Together with my friends we entered mobile apps world and launched [BeProNow.com][1]. 

Now, most of my development time I split between ruby and java world. I enjoy working on scallable infrustructure using chef, creating java application with spring, improving communication in team using cucumber tests, and lots of other.
